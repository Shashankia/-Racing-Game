🎮 **RacerX** is a top-down 2D racing game developed using **Python** and the **Pygame** library. The project simulates realistic car movement, track boundaries, and race logic — built entirely from scratch.

🛠️ **Key Features:**
- Designed multiple race tracks with visual assets and custom car sprites
- Implemented car acceleration, braking, drifting, and collision mechanics
- Handled keyboard inputs for responsive player controls
- Lap system with checkpoint validation and lap timing
- Optimized game loop and rendering for smooth performance

🚀 **Learning Outcome:**  
This project deepened my understanding of **game loops**, **event handling**, and **sprite-based graphics** in Python. It also helped improve my OOP concepts and code structuring in real-time applications.
